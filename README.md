A few years ago Flagg came with an idea, the wish to take a set of hints or 'targets' and combine them infinitely together.
This inspired a tool originally called PermutationFlagg. It would take words like "James" "Bond" "2006" and make combinations
such as: 
- JamesBond
- BondJames
- James2006BondJames
- Bond2006JamesBond
- 2006JamesBondJamesBond
And so on until the end of time. This tool named Valdicomb by Flagg - though I personally wouldn't accept it, and kept it at the original name.
It felt weird to have my name on a tool he inspired, though I ended up changing it a few months later up after seeing a conversation where it was mentioned again.

Now I release this tool in his memory hoping that others will see his idea and share in it.
Rest well Flagg, we miss you.
